# Jail Break 1, 2, 3 (Misc)

### [~$ cd ..](../)

We spent a lot of time on the first part on this challenge, because the description of the challenge misled us.
The description was an obvious reference to Matrix, when Neo chooses to follow the White Rabbit.

## Part I

We were given a [zip archive](5_T1m3s.zip) protected by a password. The name of the archive (5_T1m3s) was misleading as
well, and we tried to guess a password related to Matrix. Wrong path, brute force gave us the solution:

> ```sh
>$ fcrackzip -v -l 5 -u 5_T1m3s.zip 
>	found file 'challenge.pdf', (size cp/uc   2961/  8046, flags 9, chk b9b6)
>	found file 'instructions.asc', (size cp/uc    558/  1719, flags 9, chk b0da)
>	found file 'not_yet.zip', (size cp/uc 56341557/56341545, flags 9, chk bc08)
>	found file 'flag.txt', (size cp/uc     50/    38, flags 9, chk b5ab)
>	checking pw C8!N~                                   
>
>	PASSWORD FOUND!!!!: pw == C99tt
> ```

A few minutes were necessary to crack the password. In `flag.txt`, we got our first flag **CSC{f0b487b82fee5b144808cad2e33f2898}**

## Part II

In the decrypted archive we also found [challenge.pdf](challenge.pdf), [instructions.asc](instructions.asc), and [not_yet.zip](not_yet.zip), where
`not_yet.zip` is another password-protected archive and `instructions.asc` was recognized as:

> ```sh
>$ file instructions.asc 
>	instructions.asc: PGP message Public-Key Encrypted Session Key (old)
> ```

The PDF seems to be quite useless:

![pdf](pdf.png)

but by opening it with `nano`, we found this PDF object:

Moreover, after the first `%%EOF` marker, some data have been added:

Using the private key, we tried to decrypt the `instructions.asc`, but as we tried to import the [private key](priv.key), a password was required.
We guessed that the password could be **Mozart is not a walking dead**, and it was indeed a success:

> ```

> ... snipped ...

Last step now !

## Part III

The last part was actually the longest one. There was one remaining file we didn't use at this time, `not_yet.zip`. It was another protected zip file, which
can be unlocked using the password **Keep going you are ready for the next stage**. It contained a bunch of embedded zip files, that we unpacked with this [script](solve.py):

> ```python
>import subprocess
>import os
>
>arch = "3airqiv23gkr.zip"
>prev = ""
>name = ""
>try:
>	while True:
>		res = subprocess.check_output(["unzip", arch])
>		prev = arch
>		arch = res[res.find("extracting: ")+12:].strip()
>		name += prev + "\n"
>		os.system("rm " + prev)
>except:
>	print name
> ```

As the script ended (1h30 later), it left us with a last [password-protected archive](enterthematrix.zip) and a picture:

![opensesame.jpg](opensesame.jpg)

We used the message given in the image as a password to decrypt the ZIP, and got this [last HTML file](knockknock.html), showing nothing in a web browser.
However, but taking a look at the source code, we found:

> ```javascript

We didn't spend too much time reading the code and guessed that we had to decode the `charArr`:

> ```python
>charArr = ["1","0","0","0","0","1","1","0","1","0","1","0","0","1","1","0","1","0","0","0","0","1","1","0","1","1","1","1","0","1","1","0","1","1","0","0","1","1","0","0","0","1","1","0","1","0","1","0","0","1","1","0","0","0","0","0","1","1","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","1","0","1","0","0","0","0","1","1","0","0","0","1","0","0","1","1","0","0","1","1","0","0","1","1","0","1","0","0","0","1","1","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","1","0","0","1","1","0","0","0","1","1","1","0","0","0","0","0","1","1","0","1","1","0","0","0","1","1","1","0","0","1","0","1","1","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","1","0","1","0","0","0","0","1","1","1","0","0","1","0","0","1","1","0","1","1","1","0","0","1","1","0","1","1","0","0","0","1","1","0","0","0","1","0","1","1","0","0","0","1","1","0","1","1","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","1","0","1","0","0","0","1","1","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","1","0","0","1","1","0","0","1","1","1","0","0","0","0","1","1","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","1","0","0","1","1","0","0","0","1","1","0","1","1","1","0","0","1","1","0","1","0","0","0","0","1","1","0","1","0","0","0","1","1","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","1","1","0","0","0","0","0","1","1","1","1","1","0","1"]
