We were given [Å§his binary](generic_crackme_redux), recognized as a ELF 64-bit:

```
$ file generic_crackme_redux
generic_crackme_redux: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=c336bbc034850b821149fdb3267edcb80589a47b, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, stripped

As usual, we started with radare2:

```

Only one interesting routine here, so let's jump at `0x00001169`:

```
[0x00001070]> sf fcn.00001169
[0x00001169]> pdf
/ (fcn) fcn.00001169 29
|   fcn.00001169 ();

|           ; CALL XREF from 0x000011cb (unk)

|           0x0000117c      3d92c20a00     cmp eax, 0xac292

```

Not really difficult to understand! Starting from the end, we know that `eax` is equal to `0x56149` at `0x0000117a`, as it is added to itself and compared against `0xac292` at the next line. Dividing the constant value by two gives then `0x56149`

Besides this, we know that `eax` was equal to `edx` at `0x00001173`. The value in `eax` was then shifted to the left by 2, which means that it was multiplied by 4. Then `edx` was added to the new value, which means that the new value is 5 times the original one. If we divide `0x56149` by 5, we get `0x11375` or `70517`
