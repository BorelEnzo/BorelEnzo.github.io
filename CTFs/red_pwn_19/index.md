# Red Pwn 2019

### [~$ cd ..](../)

The write-ups cover some challenge I solved during the [Red pwn 2019](https://redpwn.net/). 926 teams took part to the competition.  
Difficulty was well-balanced, and challenges interesting, even if one of them were really frustrating (see `Dedication` ...) or with a lot of guessing
