I won't insult you by explaining once again what JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are, and how to attack them. A plethora of awesome articles exists on the Web, describing attacks such that `none` algorithm, algorithm confusion, JWK header injection, and friends ... No, I would like to tell you about something a little bit different, akin to a `jku` header injection, turning what was looking like an SSRF into an application compromise. 

Once upon a time, there was a C# single-page application using JWTs for both authentication and authorisation, being managed by the service [Auth0](https://auth0.com/). To make things more flexible, the address of the validator was not hardcoded, but dynamically retrieved with something like this:


```csharp
var jwt       = new JwtSecurityTokenHandler().ReadToken(token);
var iss       = jwt.Claims.FirstOrDefault(x => x.Type == "iss");
...

var configManager = new ConfigurationManager<OpenIdConnectConfiguration>($"{iss}/.well-known/openid-configuration", new OpenIdConnectConfigurationRetriever());
var openIdConfig  = configManager.GetConfigurationAsync().Result;
var signingKeys   = new[]{openIdConfig.JsonWebKeySet.GetSigningKey().FirstOrDefault(x => x.KeyId == kid)} ;
var tokenParams   = new Microsoft.IdentityModel.TokensTokenValidationParameters() {
  ...
  IssuerSigningKeyResolver = signingKeys
}
var claims        = jwt.ValidateToken(jwttoken, tokenParams, out var tokenout)
```

For those who get pimples while reading C#, this code can be summarised as follows: the URL of the issuer (and thus the verifier) is extracted from the token, and used to build the URL to the OIDC configuration. From there, public keys are fetched, in order to use them for token verification. In other words, it is like having a token claiming "Hey app, go ask this server to verify that I am valid !". I should have been able to sign a token with my private key, and instruct the vulnerable app to fetch my public key to verify. But of course, there was a catch ...

## First try: from arbitrary SSRF to auth bypass

By taking a look at a genuine token, I saw what the `kid` was supposed to be (let's say that `"kid": "wow-I-am-the-keyid"`). I then created a fake configuration like this, based on the genuine one, and hosted it on my server (notice the `jwks_uri`)

**openid-configuration**

```
{
  "issuer":"https://v1ct1m.auth0.com/",
  "authorization_endpoint":"https://v1ct1m.auth0.com/authorize",
  "token_endpoint":"https://v1ct1m.auth0.com/oauth/token",
  "device_authorization_endpoint":"https://v1ct1m.auth0.com/oauth/device/code",
  "userinfo_endpoint":"https://v1ct1m.auth0.com/userinfo",
  "mfa_challenge_endpoint":"https://v1ct1m.auth0.com/mfa/challenge",
  "jwks_uri":"https://4tt4ck3r.com/jwks.json",
  "registration_endpoint":"https://v1ct1m.auth0.com/oidc/register",
  "revocation_endpoint":"https://v1ct1m.auth0.com/oauth/revoke",
  "scopes_supported":[
    "openid","profile",...
  ],
...
}
```

**jwks.json**

```
{
  "keys":[
    {
      "kty":"RSA",
      "use":"sig","n":" ... here goes the modulus ...",
      "e":"AQAB",
      "kid":"wow-I-am-the-keyid",
      ...
      "alg":"RS256"}
  ]
}
```

I then edited the genuine token and replaced the `iss` by my server's URL, resent a request, and ... nothing worked, I only got timeouts. With trial and error, I finally realised that there probably was an allowlisting, preventing the app from contacting arbitrary remote hosts. Only subdomains of Auth0 seem to be allowed, and therefore, I knew what I had to do next: create my own instance !

## Creating my own Auth0 instance

The idea was simple: creating my own Auth0 instance, and use it to forge tokens that would be accepted by the vulnerable app. Adjusting claims and users, and it should be fine. Although my first idea was to export my private keys and sign arbitrary tokens, I did not find how to do so.

### Step 1: Creating a dummy app

First thing was to create a dummy application, so that an authentication endpoint would be configured.

<img width="100%" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;display:block;" alt="dummy app" src="/assets/res/stuff/auth0_1.png">

From the Auth0 dashboard, I modified the _Default application_ by setting some URLs:
* callback: http://localhost:3000/callback
* allowed logout: http://localhost:3000
* allowed web origins: http://localhost:3000

This `localhost:3000` comes from the fact that my dummy app would run on localhost:3000, more on this later.

### Step 2: Create a copycat user

Since my goal was to connect as `bob@mail.local` on the victim application, I needed to create a fake user with the same username, able to connect on my fake app. It would therefore give me a token for this dummy user, that the victim app would also accept (note that having the same username is not always necessary, but it populates the claims consistently).

<img width="100%" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;display:block;" alt="copycat" src="/assets/res/stuff/auth0_2.png">

### Step 3: Adding custom claims

The last challenge was to add custom claims that the victim app was expecting. The article [Adding Custom Claims to ID Tokens with Auth0 Actions](https://auth0.com/blog/adding-custom-claims-to-id-token-with-auth0-actions/) describes how to do so, taking as an example the application [assign-random-dog](https://github.com/auth0-blog/assign-random-dog), that is meant to run on `localhost:3000`.

Since the application expected a claim `email_address`, I configured an _Action_ to do so, adding this claim afer user authentication (only for Bob here, because it's the one I was interested in).

<img width="100%" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;display:block;" alt="action_auth0" src="/assets/res/stuff/auth0_3.png">

Finally, by deploying the _Action_ and running `npm start` in the `assign-random-dog` directory on my laptop, it opened the dummy app. Clicking on `Log in` redirects to Auth0, asking for the credentials, and I therefore entered Bob's ones.

<img width="100%" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;display:block;" alt="action_auth0" src="/assets/res/stuff/auth0_login.png">



A successful authentication would redirect to the dummy app, and by visiting the _Profile_ page while taking a look at the requests being sent, one can see that a token is obtained:

```
{
  "access_token": "...",
  "id_token": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCIsImtpZCI6Im9SSk9IN1ZRclE4a3ZNTnRzZFlMMyJ9.eyJlbWFpbF9hZGRyZXNzIjoiYm9iQG1haWwubG9jYWwiLCJuaWNrbmFtZSI6ImJvYiIsIm5hbWUiOiJib2JAbWFpbC5sb2NhbCIsInBpY3R1cmUiOiJodHRwczovL3MuZ3JhdmF0YXIuY29tL2F2YXRhci8wYmY4NGYwZTQzMmUzZGZkOTY5MWM3YTE0ZDU4ZjgyND9zPTQ4MCZyPXBnJmQ9aHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZjZG4uYXV0aDAuY29tJTJGYXZhdGFycyUyRmJvLnBuZyIsInVwZGF0ZWRfYXQiOiIyMDIzLTEyLTI4VDE5OjU1OjA0LjI1MFoiLCJlbWFpbCI6ImJvYkBtYWlsLmxvY2FsIiw...FRsZFRTMWhyYmt0VlpRPT0ifQ.o2F5z...EO9ZEIMw",
  "scope": "openid profile email",
  "expires_in": 86400,
  "token_type": "Bearer"
}
```

Once decoded, the body contains:

```
{
  "email_address":"bob@mail.local",
  "nickname":"bob",
  "name":"bob@mail.local",
  "picture":"https://s.gravatar.com/avatar/0bf84f0e432e3dfd9691c7a14d58f824?s=480&r=pg&d=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.auth0.com%2Favatars%2Fbo.png",
  "updated_at":"2023-12-28T19:55:04.250Z",
  email":"bob@mail.local",
  email_verified":true,
  "iss":"https://dev-....eu.auth0.com/",
...
}
```

<img width="100%" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;display:block;" alt="token_obtained" src="/assets/res/stuff/auth0_token.png">

This token could be used on the victim app as well, since the latter would happily validate it with my public key, and since the user `bob@mail.local` was recognised !

**Bottomline**

* Verify and then trust
* As a security researcher, it is worth trying to modify claims containing URLs to see if an SSRF exists
* It is not because cryptomagic happens that everything is secure
