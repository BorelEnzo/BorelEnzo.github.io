We were given a file named [Dragon.E01](/assets/res/CTFs/cscbe19/Dragon.E01/Dragon.E01), recognized by `file` as:

> ```sh
>$ file Dragon.E01
>Dragon.E01: EWF/Expert Witness/EnCase image file format
> ```

By googling we found that we could use `ewfmount` to mount it.

![mount](/assets/res/CTFs/cscbe19/Dragon.E01/mount.png)

Once mounted, we found another file, `ewf1`, that we analyzed with `testdisk`:

![testdisk](/assets/res/CTFs/cscbe19/Dragon.E01/testdisk.png)

The last file, with a colon, made us think about Alternate Data Stream. Hence we extracted the file, and found:

![dragon](/assets/res/CTFs/cscbe19/Dragon.E01/dragon.png)
