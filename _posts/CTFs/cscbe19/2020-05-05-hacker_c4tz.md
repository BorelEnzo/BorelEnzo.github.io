This challenge was made of 5 parts, each one giving us a flag. Unfortunately, as we wrote this write-up the website was not reachable anymore ... We faced a really simple website with the following GIF:

![cat](/assets/res/CTFs/cscbe19/hacker_c4tz/cat.gif)

and a message telling us that there was nothing interesting inside.

### 1st flag

We found our first flag in HTTP headers: **CSC{01-TastyHeaderForBreakfast}**. No real difficulty here, quite straightforward

### 2nd flag

The second flag was hidden somewhere in the js/jquery-3.3.1.min.js. Ctrl-F gave us: **CSC{02-SudoMakeMeAFlag}**

### 3rd flag

In the CSS file, we found a comment like this:

>TODO : Check CSS on port 443

On port 443 (HTTPS), the website was the same, except that we could download the certificate, giving us the third flag: **CSC{03-FourFourThreeIsKey}**

### 4th flag

CTF experience played a significant role here because this flag was not hidden in the website itself. At a moment, one of us had the good idea to check DNS records:

![dns](/assets/res/CTFs/cscbe19/hacker_c4tz/dns.png)

### 5th flag

There was an [obfuscated JS code](/assets/res/CTFs/cscbe19/hacker_c4tz/index.js) running on this website. Since we already found four flags, we supposed that the 5th one was hidden in the JS. But actually, there was no need to reverse it, and we wasted a lot of time.
By looking carefully, one could notice that the favicon was a flag:

![favicon](/assets/res/CTFs/cscbe19/hacker_c4tz/favicon.ico)

We downloaded it and ran:

> ```sh
>$ binwalk favicon.ico
>

We extracted the PNG with `dd` and ran `zsteg` on the newly created image (an `exiftool` was actually sufficient...)

![icon](/assets/res/CTFs/cscbe19/hacker_c4tz/icon.png)

and got:

> ```sh

We noticed the string **4353437b30352d596f7541726541426f6c644f6e657d** at the end of the extracted meta data, and once hex-decoded, we got: **CSC{05-YouAreABoldOne}**
