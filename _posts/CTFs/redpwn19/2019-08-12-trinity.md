The purpose of the hint was to make us understand that it was a well-known old encoding method, and the intuition made me think about morse code, where 0, 1, and 2 could represent dashes, dots and spaces.

Intuitively, I thought that 0 were dots and dashes were 1, and this guess was actually correct:

`- . .-. -. .- .-. -.-- .. ... -- --- .-. . .- .-. -.-. .- -. . -... ..- - .. -... . - -.-- --- ..- - .... --- ..- --. .... - --- ..-. .. - ..-. .. .-. ... - `

Or, once decoded:
`TERNARYISMOREARCANEBUTIBETYOUTHOUGHTOFITFIRST`
