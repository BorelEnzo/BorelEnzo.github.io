We are given a [text file](/assets/res/CTFs/cronos_18/draw_flag/DrawFlag.txt) containing a bunch of shorts instructions. According to the title, I guessed that each paragraph
draws a letter, giving the flag at the end of the day.

## First and last letter

>Go straight 100 spaces  
>Go reverse 200 spaces  
>Go straight 100 spaces  
>Turn right by 90 degrees  
>Go straight 100 spaces  
>Turn right by 90 degrees  
>Go straight 100 spaces  
>Go reverse 200 spaces  

Could be an **H** or an **I**, depending on the direction

## Second letter

>Turn right by 10 degrees  
>Go straight 200 spaces  
>Turn right by 150 degrees  
>Go straight 200 spaces  
>Go reverse 100 spaces  
>Turn right by 120 degrees  
>Go straight 50 space  

Because of the 1st and the 3rd instruction, I guessed that it was a "spiky" letter. Because of the last one, which draws a middle-sized bar, it's an **A**

## Third letter

The longest one:

>Turn left by 90 degrees  
>Go straight 50 spaces  
>Go straight 1 spaces  
>Turn left by 1 degrees  
>Go straight 1 spaces  
>Turn left by 1 degrees  
>Go straight 1 spaces  
>Turn left by 1 degrees  
>...  
>Go straight 1 spaces  
>Turn right by 1 degrees  
>Go straight 1 spaces  
>Turn right by 1 degrees  
>Go straight 1 spaces  
>Turn right by 1 degrees  
>Go straight 50 spaces  

Because of the long sequence of short distances, I guessed that is was a curvy letter. At the beginning, the curves goes to the left, and the direction changes in the middle. It's then an **S**

The flag is then "IASI", or, even better, **HASH**
