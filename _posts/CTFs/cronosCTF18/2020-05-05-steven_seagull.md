We are given a picture of Steven Seagal, dressed as a pirate.

I actually spent many hours on the first part of this challenge, because the trick to extract the hidden data of this picture was totally unexpected, and I found the solution by making a copy/paste mistake ...

I started by trying a dictionnary attack with `steghide` and rockyou.txt, but found nothing. I also tried stegsolve, same result. It made me think to the band [Steve'n'Seagulls](https://stevenseagulls.com/), then I tried to find a password related to them. Unsuccessful as well.
And finally, as I tried to copy and paste another wrong password, I accidentally put in the clipboard a leading carriage return, and was so surprised to see in my shell:

> ```sh
>% steghide extract -sf steven/steven-seagull.jpg
>Entrez la passphrase:
>Ecriture des donnÃ©es extraites dans "nostash".
> ```

The passphrase was actually empty ... The rest of the challenge was then quite straightforward.

> ```sh
>% file nostash
>nostash: Squashfs filesystem, little endian, version 4.0, 382 bytes, 2 inodes, blocksize: 131072 bytes, created: Mon Sep 10 15:27:55 2018
> ```

Let's mount it:

> ```sh
># mkdir /mnt/steven
># mount nostash /mnt/steven
># ls /mnt/steven
># cat /mnt/steven/PornStash.txt
>In case i forgot where me stash was:

>Hope me mateys don't find out i'm not taking care of the ship!

Okay, let's download the video:

> ```sh

>% mv StevenSeagullWare.mkv\?dl=0 steven.mkv

The .mkv was actually an archive, giving me a real mp4 video. No need to analyze deeper, I only had to use my old friend `strings`:

> ```sh
>% strings StevenSeagullWare.mp4|grep flag
