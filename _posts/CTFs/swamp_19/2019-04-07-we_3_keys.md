This challenge was easy, but quite fun! We were given the [code](/assets/res/CTFs/swamp19/we_3_keys/serv.py) of the service running on port 1441:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python2
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from keys import key1, key2, key3

def pkcs7_pad(msg):
    val = 16 - (len(msg) % 16)
    if val == 0:
        val = 16
    pad_data = msg + (chr(val) * val)
    return pad_data

def encrypt_message(key, IV):
    print("What message woud you like to encrypt (in hex)?")
    ptxt = raw_input("<= ")
    ptxt = pkcs7_pad(ptxt.decode('hex'))
    cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, IV)
    ctxt = cipher.encrypt(ptxt)
    print ctxt.encode('hex')

def decrypt_message(key, IV):
    print("What message would you like to decrypt (in hex)?")
    ctxt = raw_input("<= ")
    ctxt = ctxt.decode('hex')
    if (len(ctxt) % 16) != 0:
        print "What a fake message, I see through your lies"
        return
    cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, IV)
    ptxt = cipher.decrypt(ctxt)
    print ptxt.encode('hex')

def new_key():
    print("Which key would you like to use now? All 3 are great")
    key_opt = str(raw_input("<= "))
    if key_opt == "1":
        key = key1
    elif key_opt == "2":
        key = key2
    elif key_opt == "3":
        key = key3
    else:
        print("Still no, pick a real key plz")
        exit()
    return key

def main():
    print("Hello! We present you with the future kings, we three keys!")
    print("Pick your key, and pick wisely!")
    key_opt = str(raw_input("<= "))
    if key_opt == "1":
        key = key1
    elif key_opt == "2":
        key = key2
    elif key_opt == "3":
        key = key3
    else:
        print("Come on, I said we have 3!")
        exit()
    while True:
        print("1) Encrypt a message")
        print("2) Decrypt a message")
        print("3) Choose a new key")
        print("4) Exit")
        choice = str(raw_input("<= "))
        if choice == "1":
            encrypt_message(key, key)
        elif choice == "2":
            decrypt_message(key, key)
        elif choice == "3":
            key = new_key()
        else:
            exit()


if __name__=='__main__':
    main()
```

The major flaw here is the fact the pair key/IV is reused, and furthermore, they are the same. It means that if we can leak the IV, we have the key, and therefore we can decrypt or encrypt whatever we want. Since there is no real flag in this script, we guessed that we had to use the concatenation of the 3 keys to get the flag.

As a reminder, CBC mode works as follows (wikipedia):

![CBC enc](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/CBC_encryption.svg)
![CBC dec](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/CBC_decryption.svg)

The idea is then to provide a plaintext full of null bytes (padded with a block full of 0x10, but we don't care), and therefore we can obtain (padding is ignored): `enc(IV ^ 0x00000000000000000000000000000000) = enc(IV) = enc(KEY)`

Then, we can ask for the decryption of `0x00000000000000000000000000000000 || enc(KEY) || padding` (`||` being the concatenation). Indeed, the second block, once decrypted will be XOR'ed with null-bytes, meaning that we have the key as plain text in the second block:

>plaintext=   
>dec(0x00000000000000000000000000000000)^IV +  
>dec(enc(KEY))^0x00000000000000000000000000000000 +  
>dec(padding^enc(KEY))

Step by step procedure for the first key:

* Encrypt a full-of-null-byte-block
```
Hello! We present you with the future kings, we three keys!
Pick your key, and pick wisely!
<= 1
1) Encrypt a message
2) Decrypt a message
3) Choose a new key
4) Exit
<= 1
What message woud you like to encrypt (in hex)?

c921fca7080c90790bb85def50eaf466fda2febcef1d1a4cd6552dea3a65617e
```
* The encrypted key is the first block: `c921fca7080c90790bb85def50eaf466`. We then ask for the decryption of `16 * 0x00 || enc(KEY) || padding`
```

```
* 2nd block is the decrypted IV: `666c61677b7730775f776834745f6c34`

We can use the same procedure for the second and third key:

```
1) Encrypt a message
2) Decrypt a message

4) Exit

```

By concatenating the 3 keys, we obtained: `666c61677b7730775f776834745f6c347a795f6b33797a5f6d7563685f7733346b5f6372797074305f6634316c73217d`, and once hex-decoded: **flag{w0w_wh4t_l4zy_k3yz_much_w34k_crypt0_f41ls!}**
