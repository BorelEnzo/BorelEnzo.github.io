Please don't abuse this server! This FTP server is used to share my favourite cats (there's only one thing I like more than cats). Feel free to browse through them and download your favourites. If you want to add your own cats shoot me a mail (darthcatlover9001@sharklasers.com) and I'll give you a user account. The cats you add will then appear in the /users/username/public folder.

If you're into lists instead of cats you might also like my other FTP server. I sometimes get confused so if I misplaced a list on this server please let me know.
